# todoist-late-reset

A basic Go program to reset certain tasks in Todoist if they're completed 'late'.

## Story

I need tasks that I complete after midnight to be automatically rescheduled for the same day so that I can still complete them the next day (without having to manually reschedule each one I complete late).

This is effective for people like me who are still active (or may review their tasks) after midnight.
